# Credit Card Fraud Detection with k-NN and k-Fold Cross-Validation 🛡️

## Introduction 📚

Welcome to this repository! We're diving into the critical issue of credit card fraud detection. Utilizing the k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN) algorithm and k-Fold Cross-Validation, we sift through a synthetic dataset to flag fraudulent transactions.

## Requirements 🛠️

To get started, you'll need:

- Python 3.9 🐍
- Jupyter Notebook 📓
- pandas 🐼
- numpy ➕
- scikit-learn 🤖

## Installation ⚙️

Setting up is straightforward:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Run `pip install notebook` to get Jupyter Notebook up and running.
3. Install the necessary Python packages with `pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn`.

## Usage 🖥️

To execute the notebook:

1. Navigate to the repository folder in your terminal.
2. Launch Jupyter Notebook with `jupyter notebook`.
3. Open `YourNotebook.ipynb` from the dashboard.

## Methodology 📈

We employ the k-NN algorithm for classification and validate our model using k-Fold Cross-Validation. This ensures a robust and reliable model. Key performance metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score are also calculated.

## Results 🏆

The model's performance metrics are impressive:

- Accuracy: 99%
- Precision: 99%
- Recall: 99%
- F1 Score: 99%

These metrics indicate that the model is highly effective in detecting credit card fraud and is ready for real-world deployment.
